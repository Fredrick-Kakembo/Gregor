# Team_Gregor_HackBio2021
### We are a team of 20 people for the HackBio'2021 Virtual Bioinformatics Internship.

**Project Aim:** This is the main repository created for the HackBio'2021 Project. The task is to write small scripts in different languages and produce the desired output as name, email, slack_username (with @) your bio stack, twitter_handle, and hamming_distance between your slack handle and Twitter handle. The next step is to make csv file with rows corresponding to the person and columns to the values (as name, e-mail, etc) in bash.

**Languages used:** Python, Julia, C++, R, Java, MATLAB, Javascript, C.

**Desired output template:**

```
Name: *Your full name*
Email: *Your e-mail*
Slack Username: @+*username*
BioStack: *Name of bio stack you chose. The only first letter is capital*
Twitter handle: *Your Twitter id*
Hamming distance: *This distance is used to compare two binary data strings*
```

**Example:**
```
Name: John Doe
Email: email@gmail.com
Slack Username: @John
BioStack: Genomics
Twitter handle: @
Hamming distance: 5
```

**## Note:** After getting the above output, please name your file as stage_0_slack-username. For instance: stage_0_john.jl

**Main Goal:** To create a bash script that will clone the repository and produce a csv file with the participants' personal information. For this, no installation is required, however, check if all dependencies are satisfied.
